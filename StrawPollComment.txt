Please use emoji reactions ON THIS COMMENT to indicate your position on this proposal.

* You do not need to vote on every proposal
* If you have no opinion, don't vote - that is also useful data
* If you've already commented on this issue, please still vote so
      we know your current thoughts
* Not all proposals solve exactly the same problem, so we may end
      up accepting proposals that appear to have some overlap
This is not a binding majority-rule vote, but it will be a very
significant input into the corresponding ASC decision.

Here are the meanings for the emojis:

* Hooray or Rocket: I support this so strongly that I
      want to be an advocate for it
* Heart: I think this is an ideal solution
* Thumbs up: I'd be happy with this solution
* Confused: I'd rather we not do this, but I can tolerate it
* Thumbs down: I'd be actively unhappy, and may even consider
      other technologies instead
If you want to explain in more detail, feel free to add another
comment, but please also vote on this comment.
